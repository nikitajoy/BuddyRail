                BuddyRail is totally free, but if you want to, you can help by donating. It's pretty hard to accept payments in Russia, so I'm using <a href="https://boosty.to/online_kino" target="_blank">Boosty</a>. You can also make <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=1071903555&token=fpLMvyUm" target="_blank">a donation with Steam skins</a>.
